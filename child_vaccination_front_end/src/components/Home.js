                    diseases which can include amputation of an arm or leg, paralysis of limbs, hearing loss, convulsions, brain damage, and death.
                    Vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, and whooping cough, are still a threat.
                    If children aren’t vaccinated, they can spread the disease to other children who are too young to be vaccinated or to people
                     with weakened immune systems, such as transplant recipients and people with cancer. This could result in long-term complications 
                     and even death for these vulnerable people.</h6>

                    refers to the act of giving a vaccine to a person.</h6>
